Hi, I'm **Gabriel Monteiro da Silva**!<br>  

I'm a PhD candidate at **[Brown University]**, where I study how changes in the conformational landscape of proteins can affect their function, specifically in the context of resistance-causing mutations in human kinases.

I use rigorous simulations and modeling to predict the dynamics of bimolecular systems containing hundreds of thousands of atoms, with millions of degrees of freedom.

I also develop next-generation [methods and heuristics] for accelerating the sampling of the dynamics of complex macromolecular systems.

Beyond research, I love making generative art about molecular biophysics (check out my [protein art]). 

I also enjoy gaming with my friends, introducing people to Brazilian EDM (and to Brazilian anything), drinking good beer, reading good books, and watching good movies.

Welcome to my personal website and blog!
