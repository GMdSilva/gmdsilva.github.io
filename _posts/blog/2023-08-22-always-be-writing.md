# Always be Writing

Writing is the hardest part of my job. 

It is also the most important part of my job.

If I don't write, no one besides my advisors will ever see my discoveries if I don't publish them.  My collaborators, mentees, and colleagues who helped with my project are relying on me to get their contributions out there.  

Perhaps even more importantly, I write because my research is funded with the objective of improving human lives, and publication is a requirement for achieving that goal. 

Thus, I write. 

With graduation looming and projects reaching natural conclusions, I feel a self-afflicted pressure to write more every day. To put pen to paper and translate months or even years of experiments and analyses into the structured format of a scientific paper. 

This writing anxiety is neither novel nor without reason. I felt the same pressure before publishing my previous papers, and realized that writing often is vital for an aspiring scientist seeking to make an impact in a fast-moving field. 

Still, I would rather be running simulations, analyzing results, reading papers, giving talks, having meetings, or doing pretty much any other part of the job. Even doing the dishes sometimes feels more alluring than writing.

That being said, I don't actually hate writing. I learned to enjoy parts of it - especially the feeling one gets when a paper is done - but it's just not as fun as everything else. Definitely not as fun as research.

Research tends to follow a very structured and mostly linear approach: I start with a few hypotheses and ideas on methods for testing them, which I systematically implement and adjust based on observations until the hypotheses are sufficiently tested within the boundaries of the defined scope. Following that, I critically evaluate results, and decide on the next steps accordingly.

It's a lot like protein folding. 

Projects and proteins start at the top of a hill of potential outcomes, and through flexible but mostly constrained steps they eventually reach a stable outcome. Both might get stuck for a while, and might vacillate between different forms based on internal and external forces, but the path is mostly linear.

Bar for technological and epistemological limitations, even the most rugged project landscape can be traversed with systematic steps. The structured nature of scientific projects makes research a very enjoyable activity to me, and I am happy to spend most of my time doing it.

Writing, on the other hand, is unpredictable and borderline chaotic. Prose starts at seemingly arbitrary positions, takes sudden leaps, goes back and fourth a dozen of times, and never truly feels like it's done. What seems like a logical end to a sentence or paragraph might reveal itself an awkward fragment upon review, and it's never clear when to stop reviewing and editing.

It's a lot like evolution.

The traits that make a species fit for a particular environment are usually quite obvious, but the path that led to their emergence and fixation is an impossibly complex kaleidoscope of dead-ends and backtracking. Not surprisingly, gains in fitness usually require thousands of years of trial and error.

Save for the trial and error part, writing is similar. The differences between a brilliant and a mediocre paragraph are almost axiomatic once they're put side to side, but the path to transform the latter in the former is murky and treacherous.

To facilitate this journey, I often try to break down writing in the sum of its parts. I treat it as multi-parameter optimization challenge: a careful balance of clarity, allure, and accuracy to bake a prose cake. 

Please don't tell John Keating.

This works well as a starting step, but is hardly an infallible strategy. The specific proportions of writing ingredients are not set in stone and tend to fluctuate wildly depending on context and purpose. Balancing engagement and accuracy is far from easy, but what truly vexes me about writing is the *je ne sais quoi* quality of good prose.

This is best illustrated with an example. Consider these two sentences:

1. "While I was walking to the store, I saw a cat."
2. "I saw a cat on my way to the store."

Most will find sentence 2 to be better written than sentence 1, even if sentence 2 carries more information by specifying the mode of transportation. 

The reason for this preference is clear: in most contexts where a person might communicate spotting a cat, the mode of transportation is inconsequential. Specifying it is not worth the sacrifice to flow enforced by the comma, and this logic makes perfect sense to me. 

Sadly, things start getting complicated when we attempt to make sentence 2 flow as well as sentence 1. Such as by rephrasing it as sentence 3:

3. "I saw a cat while walking to the store."

Sentence 3 includes just as much information as 1, and **should** flow as well as 2, given the lack of pause and equal number of syllables (10). It should be the best written of the trio. Yet, it's not. 

I can't really explain why sentence 3 seems to be worse than sentence 2, but it just does. Perhaps it's the alliteration? "While walking" is certainly more awkward than "On my way", but I can't tell you why.

Here's my running hypothesis:

Good prose is rarely crafted bureaucratically. In writing, sentences should evolve organically; blending the essential elements of communication naturally. Methodical balancing of intangibles might get you halfway there, but it's not enough. You need the right vibes.

Writing is not baking. It's gardening.

But how to train that muscle? Focused exercises improve my grammar, vocabulary, and stylistics; but I have no idea how to get better at the intangibles of writing besides, well, just writing more.

Thus, I write; and the more I write, the easier writing gets. 

But you've got to keep doing it. That's the hard part.
